{-
Fun little backstory here!

I was working on some code for Graph Theory (trying to calculate the characteristic polynomial of the adjacency matrix of a path graph in Idris), and it was taking a REALLY long time for large polynomials.

I guessed this was because I was calculating a lot of factorials (within chooses), using my recursive factorial function that I implemented. To check this, I tried taking the factorial of larger numbers, and it was very slow.

I remembered that memoization is a way to solve this, but couldn't find a standard way to do this in Idris. I found the STRef mutable reference thingy (after some ChatGPT inspiration, but this is all my own code) and wrote this. I can now calculate polynomials quickly in that code, and have a tool that I know will be useful for future days :)
